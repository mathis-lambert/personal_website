        "content": "Most apps that \"use AI\" still behave like calculators: you ask, they answer. Agentic AI flips the flow. An agent senses a situation, forms a plan, calls tools and services, reads the right context, and iterates until a goal is met. Add RAG, and the agent gains a working memory of your corpus so it answers from facts, not vibes. ([NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/))\n\n> **TL;DR**: Pair a planning loop with typed tool calls, a retrieval stack that you can measure, and strict safety boundaries. Ship small goals first, then grow autonomy.\n\n---\n\n### 1) What makes an AI \"agentic\"?\n\nAn agentic system wraps a language model with four capabilities:\n\n1. **Perception**: read user input, events, and documents.\n2. **Planning**: break a goal into steps, choose tools, and order them.\n3. **Action**: invoke typed tools and external systems; observe results.\n4. **Learning**: write useful facts to memory and adjust the next step.\n\nThis is different from a chat UI. It is a control loop that keeps running until a termination condition is met or a human says stop. In practice, the loop is implemented as a task graph or state machine rather than a single monolithic prompt. ([NVIDIA Blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/), [LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/))\n\n```mermaid \n ---\nconfig:\n theme: dark\n layout: dagre\n---\nflowchart LR\n  A[Goal / Trigger] --> B[Planner]\n  B --> C{Choose Tool}\n  C -->|Search| R[Retriever]\n  C -->|API| T[Typed Function]\n  R --> G[Grounded Context]\n  T --> O[Observation]\n  G --> S[Solver LLM]\n  O --> S\n  S --> B\n  S -->|Stop / Output| P[Product]\n```\n\n#### Why now\nFrontier models handle language, but tools and structured environments deliver reliability. You can run the planner with a small controller model and reserve big models for hard parts. This reduces cost and latency while increasing predictability. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153))\n\n---\n\n### 2) Tool use: the agent’s hands\n\nAgents act via **typed functions**. The model emits a JSON call that matches a schema; your runtime executes it and streams back the result for the next reasoning step.\n\n**Design rules**\n\n- **Schema first**: name, description, parameters with types and enums. Treat it like a public API.\n- **Idempotence**: make calls safe to retry; include `request_id` inputs and detect duplicates.\n- **Tight scopes**: one tool per capability; avoid \"doEverything()\".\n- **Observability**: log inputs, outputs, latency, and errors; attach the log to the agent’s next turn.\n\n> Function calling exists so models return structured calls reliably, not free-text that you must parse. Use it. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/function-calling-and-other-api-updates/), [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling))\n\n**Minimal tool schema**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"function\",\n  \"name\": \"search_tickets\",\n  \"description\": \"Search support tickets by query and status.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"query\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"status\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"open\", \"closed\", \"all\"]},\n      \"limit\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 1, \"maximum\": 100}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"query\"],\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n  },\n  \"strict\": true\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3) Orchestration: from loops to graphs\n\nReal tasks branch, fail, and retry. Model it explicitly:\n\n- **Finite-state machines** for straight pipelines.\n- **Graphs** for multi-agent or tool-rich flows where nodes can run in parallel and pass state.\n\nGraph frameworks make step boundaries explicit, persist state, and let you recover mid-run. You can encode policies like \"after three tool errors, escalate to human\" or \"if retrieval confidence is low, re-plan.\" ([LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/build-agentic-workflows-langgraph-granite))\n\n---\n\n### 4) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): the agent’s library\n\nRAG adds a fast, measurable knowledge path:\n\n1. **Chunking**: split documents into self-contained pieces.\n2. **Embedding**: map chunks to vectors for semantic search.\n3. **Retrieval**: fetch candidates with vector search or hybrid search.\n4. **Re-ranking**: use a cross-encoder to order candidates.\n5. **Grounded generation**: answer with citations to the retrieved text.\n\nThis structure is now the de facto pattern. It reduces hallucinations and lets you control freshness and access. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.18910v1), [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview))\n\n#### Practical choices that matter\n\n- **Chunking**: prefer semantic or heading-aware splits; overlap 10–20% to preserve context windows.\n- **Hybrid retrieval**: combine vector and BM25 for misspellings and rare terms.\n- **Re-ranking**: re-score the top-k with a cross-encoder; move the best 5–20 into the prompt.\n- **Query rewriting**: expand or decompose the user query before retrieval.\n- **Freshness**: index docs continuously and version the index to enable rollbacks.\n\nRe-ranking is the workhorse for quality jumps in enterprise RAG because it fixes coarse vector recall with a precise pairwise scorer. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.18910v1), [ragflow.io](https://ragflow.io/blog/the-rise-and-evolution-of-rag-in-2024-a-year-in-review))\n\n#### A compact RAG call the agent can reuse\n`ts\ninterface RetrievalRequest {\n  query: string\n  topK?: number // 50 for recall, then re-rank\n  filters?: Record<string, string | number | boolean>\n}\n\ninterface RetrievedDoc {\n  id: string\n  text: string\n  source: string\n  score: number\n}\n\n// 1) dense+BM25 -> 2) re-rank -> 3) pack\n`\n\n---\n\n### 5) Making agents and RAG work together\n\n**Loop sketch**\n`pseudo\nwhile not done:\n  plan = planner(state)\n  if plan.needs_context:\n    ctx = retrieve(plan.query)\n    state.context = ctx\n  result = act(plan.tool, plan.args)\n  observe(result)\n  done = goal_check(state)\n`\n\n**Key integration points**\n\n- Let the **planner** ask for retrieval explicitly. This keeps tool calls and context under budget.\n- Cache retrieval results by `(query_hash, filters, corpus_version)`.\n- When confidence is low, branch: *re-retrieve → re-rank → decompose question*. Handle this as graph nodes, not prompt hacks. ([LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/))\n\n---\n\n### 6) Reliability, safety, and guardrails\n\nAgentic systems can chain mistakes. Bound the blast radius:\n\n- **Zero trust for tools**: narrow scopes, per-tool credentials, allow-lists, rate limits.\n- **Prompt-injection defense**: never execute instructions found in retrieved content; treat corpus as untrusted input.\n- **Human-in-the-loop**: require approvals for state-changing actions.\n- **Policy as code**: encode stop conditions and approvals in the graph, not in prose prompts.\n\nThese are classical security controls adapted to agents. The solutions are mostly operational discipline plus visibility, not exotic research. ([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/agentic-ais-security-risks-are-challenging-but-the-solutions-are-surprisingly-simple))\n\n---\n\n### 7) Measurement: what to track and why\n\nYou cannot improve what you cannot see. Track:\n\n- **Retrieval**: context precision/recall, MRR/NDCG, coverage by document type.\n- **Answer quality**: faithfulness to sources, grounded citation rate, factuality audits.\n- **Run health**: tool error rates, retries, mean/percentile latencies, token and cash budgets.\n\nRecent surveys catalogue RAG-specific metrics and datasets; borrow their checklists when you build your eval harness. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.14891v1))\n\n---\n\n### 8) Latency and cost engineering\n\n- Use a **small controller model** for planning and tool selection; invoke larger models only for hard generations.\n- Pre-warm connections to critical tools. Parallelize independent nodes.\n- **Shard the index** by business unit; route queries to the smallest viable corpus.\n- Memoize deterministic steps and paginate long traces to storage. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153))\n\n---\n\n### 9) Where agents + RAG already fit\n\n- **Customer support**: triage → retrieve policy → propose action → file ticket updates.\n- **Internal ops**: reconcile data across systems, draft change requests, open PRs with diffs.\n- **Research assistants**: map a question into sub-questions, retrieve, and produce a brief with links.\n\nLarge players are publicly investing in agents for multi-step, high-reliability workflows, not just chat. Expect the stack around planning, tools, and sims to mature fast. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/761830/amazon-david-luan-agi-lab-adept-ai-interview))\n\n---\n\n### 10) A starter blueprint you can implement this week\n\n1. **Define goals** as typed events: `\"answer_question\"`, `\"draft_update\"`, `\"file_change\"`.\n2. **Register tools** with strict JSON schemas and idempotent behavior.\n3. **Stand up RAG** with hybrid retrieval and re-ranking. Version the index.\n4. **Build a graph**: nodes for `plan`, `retrieve`, `act`, `review`, `stop`. Persist state per run.\n5. **Add guardrails**: approval gates for state changes; redact secrets from logs.\n6. **Instrument**: structured logs per node, per-tool SLAs, and weekly eval runs.\n\nIf you do just these, you’ll have a dependable agent that thinks, reads, and acts—on your terms.\n",
